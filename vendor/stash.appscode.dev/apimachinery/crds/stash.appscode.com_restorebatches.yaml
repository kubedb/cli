                                are three important differences between dataSource
                                and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                      fields are non-empty, they must have the same
                                      value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace
                                      isn''t specified in dataSourceRef, both fields
                                      (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to
                                      the same value automatically if one of them
                                      is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace
                                      is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t
                                      set to the same value and must be empty. There
                                      are three important differences between dataSource
                                      and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                      two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is specified. * While dataSource only
                                      allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires
                                      the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      capacity when a volume expansion operation is
                                      requested. For storage quota, the larger value

                                      is used. If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources
                                      alone is used for quota calculation. If a volume
                                      expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources
                                      is only lowered if there are no expansion operations
                                      in progress and if the actual volume capacity
                                      is equal or lower than the requested capacity.

                                      for resizing capacity of the volume, should
                                      ignore PVC updates that change other valid resources
