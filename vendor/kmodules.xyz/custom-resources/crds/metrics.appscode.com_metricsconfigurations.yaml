                            == 'Running') \n percentage(percent, total, roundUp) returns
                            the value of (percent * total%) when `percent` contains
                            the percent(%) value. If percent represents an Integer
                            value, then it will simply return it. roundUp is an optional
                            field. By default, its value is false. If roundUp is set
                            as `true`, the resultant value will be rounded up. example:
                            (i) percentage(\"25%\", 4) will return 1.         (ii)
                            percentage(\"25%\", 1 , true) will return 1 as roundUp
                            is set as true.        (iii) percentage(2, 4) will return
                            2 as percent is representing an Integer value. \n cpu_cores()
                            returns the cpu in unit core example: cpu_cores(cpu),
                            for cpu value 150m, it will return 0.15 \n bytes() returns
                            the memory size in byte example: bytes(memory), for memory
                            value 1 ki, it will return 1024 \n unix() returns the
                            DateTime string into unix format. example: unix(dateTime)
                            will return the corresponding unix value for the given

                                      as labels but there is no specific metric value.
                                      \n Example: For metrics \"kube_pod_info\", there
                                      are some information like host_ip, pod_ip, node
                                      name is collected as labels. As there must be
                                      a metric value, metric value is kept as 1. The
                                      metric will look like `kube_pod_info{host_ip=\"172.18.0.2\",
                                      pod_ip=\"10.244.0.14\", node=\"kind-control-plane\"
                                      .....}  1`"

                                  valueFromExpression:

                                      expression for the metric value expression can
                                      be a function as well. Parameters is used in
                                      the expression string \n Available expression
                                      evaluation functions are: \n int() returns 1
                                      if the expression is true otherwise 0, example:
                                      int(phase == 'Running') \n percentage(percent,
                                      total, roundUp) returns the value of (percent
                                      * total%) when `percent` contains the percent(%)
                                      value. If percent represents an Integer value,
                                      then it will simply return it. roundUp is an
                                      optional field. By default, its value is false.
                                      If roundUp is set as `true`, the resultant value
                                      will be rounded up. example: (i) percentage(\"25%\",
                                      4) will return 1.         (ii) percentage(\"25%\",
                                      1 , true) will return 1 as roundUp is set as
                                      true.        (iii) percentage(2, 4) will return
                                      2 as percent is representing an Integer value.
                                      \n cpu_cores() returns the cpu in unit core
                                      example: cpu_cores(cpu), for cpu value 150m,
                                      it will return 0.15 \n bytes() returns the memory
                                      size in byte example: bytes(memory), for memory
                                      value 1 ki, it will return 1024 \n unix() returns
                                      the DateTime string into unix format. example:
                                      unix(dateTime) will return the corresponding
                                      unix value for the given dateTime \n in above
                                      examples phase, replicas, maxUnavailable, cpu,
                                      memory, dateTime are Parameter's key those values
                                      will come from corresponding Parameter's value
                                      \n Some expression evaluation functions are
                                      used for calculating resource requests and limits.
                                      Those functions are stated here: https://github.com/kmodules/resource-metrics/blob/master/eval.go"
