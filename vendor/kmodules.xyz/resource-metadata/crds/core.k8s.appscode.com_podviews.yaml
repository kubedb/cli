                description: "The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of
                  where the Pod is in its lifecycle. The conditions array, the reason
                  and message fields, and the individual container status arrays contain
                  more detail about the pod's status. There are five possible phase
                  values: \n Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes
                  system, but one or more of the container images has not been created.
                  This includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent
                  downloading images over the network, which could take a while. Running:
                  The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have
                  been created. At least one container is still running, or is in
                  the process of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers
                  in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
                  Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least
                  one container has terminated in failure. The container either exited
                  with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. Unknown: For
                  some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically
                  due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod. \n More
