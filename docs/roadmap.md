# Project Status

## Versioning Policy
There are 2 parts to versioning policy:

 - Operator & cli version: KubeDB follows semver versioning policy. Until 1.0 release is done, there might be breaking changes between point releases of the operator. Please always check the release notes for upgrade instructions.
 - CRD version: `kubedb.com/v1alpha1` is considered in alpha. This means breaking changes to the YAML format might happen among different releases of the operator.
